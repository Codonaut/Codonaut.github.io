Starting SICP
=============

Two weeks ago I started reading and working my way through the famous computing tome SICP, or *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*.  I've heard raving reviews of this book practically everywhere-- it's all over Hacker News, and sports glowing reviews from the likes of [Peter Norvig](http://www.amazon.com/review/R403HR4VL71K8) and [Paul Graham](http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G05B1TQ5XGZP).

So far I've really been enjoying working through SICP.  The exercises usually involve solving a problem with Scheme-- though the focus is more on the problem than the language.  Each one has consistently been giving me a mental workout, whipping me back into mathematical shape.  It's college Algorithms class all over again!  

My goals for working through SICP can be summarized in a few broad categories:

* Strengthen problem solving skills
* Evolve the abstractions I use to think about programming
* Learn how to better construct simple, robust systems
* Learn about the construction of an interpreter
* Learn functional programming concepts
* Learn me a lisp

All those goals are pretty vague, but I think that's ok.  This book isn't about one aspect of programming, but the craft as a whole.  I view working on SICP as both a fun way to spend my time, and an investment in stronger fundamentals of programming and problem solving thinking that will enhance every aspect of computing.  I'm understanding more and more everyday the fact that solid fundamentals are *the single most important thing* in learning a skill.  My plan is to beef up my fundamental programming skills before beginning to specialize more.

Oh yeah, and this book is big!  It's 700 pages of exercise packed knowledge.  In the last two weeks I've gotten through 2.5 of the 3 sections in the first chapter, and I hear it only gets tougher as it goes on.  Anyway, time to jump back in, happy SICP'ing!
