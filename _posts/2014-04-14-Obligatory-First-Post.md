The Obligatory First Blog Post
==============================

What is every first post on every blog about?  You guessed it-- answering the question of why the blog exists at all.  Not being one to break tradition, I'll stick to the tried and tested formula.  

So: Finally, at long last, and without further ado, why does this blog exist?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This blog exists as a place for me to write about programming, problem solving, and that entertaining squirrel in my yard that stacks his acorns just so.  I'll be writing about projects I'm working on, technologies that interest me, or other things that interest me.  My hope is that in writing about these topics they will become clearer to me, and I'll better be able to identify gaps in my knowledge as I try to explain them to the vast unwashed internet hordes(i.e. you).  Ok, first post concluded, time to move on to more interesting topics.
